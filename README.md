# GestureVolumeControl
Volume control on windows laptop using computer vision hand tracking
# How to use
Run the GestureControl.py file that internally uses the libraries in handTrackingModule.py 
# Notes
The volume control has been optimized for my hand length, so the parameters for the max volume hand length might have to be adapted if you are not able to reach 100% volume with the hand pinch or reaching 100% volume for too little of hand pinch.
